# Challenge Notes

## Making production ready

* Test coverage.
* Monitoring, structured logging etc.
* Templated abstractions for deployments.
* Include swagger etc for API docs.

Pretty basic stuff really.

## Making production deployment ready

* Abstractions over the deployment manifests, perhaps through managed deployment tool.
* Smoke tests for verifying green deployments would be great.
* Much more monitoring and logging hooks.
* Set up a proper gated build / cd pipeline.
